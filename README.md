# pacman

This code creates a simple animation of Pac-Man moving forward and backward across the screen. 
The animation starts when the "Start" button is clicked.
Two images (one for moving forward and one for moving backward) alternate as Pac-Man moves along the screen.
The position is updated at regular intervals using setInterval(), with the direction changing once the Pac-Man reaches the edge of the screen.
The velocityChange function controls both the movement and the switching between forward and backward directions.
